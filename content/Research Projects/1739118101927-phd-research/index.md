## New Right on YouTube: Uses and Abuses of History

This research is in its initial phase and aims to analyze the uses and abuses of history by the new right on YouTube. The project will focus on the period from 2012 to 2023, considering the consolidation of the new right in the Brazilian public sphere and the digital environment. The research will analyze the videos of the main channels of the new right on YouTube that address, in some way, the past, as well as the comments of the users of these channels. The objective is to understand the negationist nature of the narratives disseminated by these channels, as well as the strategies used to legitimize them. The research will also seek to identify the main historical themes addressed by the new right, as well as the main historical references used to support their arguments. The project will be developed in the context of the Digital Humanities and Critical Internet Studies, seeking to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between history, memory, and digital media.
