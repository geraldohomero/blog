I've always been deeply curious about technology, and over the years, my interest has blossomed into a full-fledged passion. During my undergraduate and graduate studies in History, I had the opportunity to delve into the world of Digital History, which introduced me to Linux and the open-source community. Witnessing the profound impact of technology on our lives fueled my intrigue even further.

In 2018, I made the complete switch to Linux, a decision I have never regretted! Through my Linux journey, I have acquired invaluable lessons, the most important being that there is no problem without a solution.
In 2022, I embarked on my journey in Web Development at PUC Minas, diligently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, MySQL, C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have been actively pursuing self-study in various technologies that have piqued my interest, such as Rust, Vue.js, Docker, and Kubernetes.
